<h1>Private Spaceflight in 2023</h1>
<p>
    The last couple years have seen huge progress in opportunities for private citizens to fly to space, with three new vehicles flying for the first time. Some have continued to progress well, others have stalled. Below I take a closer look at what 2023 has in store. </p>

    <h2>SpaceX</h2>
    <h3>A major Starship test and two private Dragon flights</h3>
    <img class="left" src="./Starship-and-booster-with-labels.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">
<p>In the next few weeks we should see the first orbital launch of SpaceX’s massive new Starship vehicle. They recently completed a firing of 31 of the 33 engines at the same time. It was quite a sight. Once they receive the go ahead from the FAA, they will attempt to launch this gigantic rocket into Earth orbit. Starship is planned to not only launch payload into space, but also humans, with Space Adventures’ orbital spaceflight client Yusaku Maezawa awaiting his DearMoon flight around the Moon, and Jared Isaacman slated to fly to low-Earth orbit on the third Polaris mission (see more below).</p>
<p>SpaceX also operate the most reliable human spacecraft currently on the market, the Dragon. This year should see a couple different missions with private citizens on board. First is the Axiom AX-2 mission, really a private citizen / government astronaut mixed flight. Scheduled for May the flight will carry four astronauts to the International Space Station for a 10 day stay – one fare-paying private citizen, two professional Saudi astronauts and one Axiom professional astronaut who will serve as an in orbit guide.</p>
<p>Then later in the summer we should see the Polaris Dawn mission. After the Inspiration4 mission in September 2021, billionaire Jared Isaacman announced the Polaris Program. The first mission – Polaris Dawn – will fly to low-Earth orbit (but not to the ISS) and has the ambitious goal of opening the spacecraft door and allowing at least one crew member to complete a spacewalk.</p>

    <h2>High altitude balloons</h2>
    <h3>An experience worth keeping an eye on.</h3>
    <img class="right" src="./halo-space-capsule-tourism-2025-balloon.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">
<p>A new addition to the human space experience options, and I think worthy of a mention for the first time is high-altitude balloon flights.  These flights are designed to carry a group of 6-8 passengers to 30 km above Earth’s surface for a multi-hour cruise, all for a 5 or 6 figures price tag. There are three companies WorldView, Space Perspective and Halo Space making steady progress. While we don’t expect any of them to carry people this year, they are getting close, and it’s worth keeping an eye on.</p>
<p>High altitude balloons are large balloons that are designed to ascend to high altitudes in the Earth's atmosphere, typically reaching altitudes of 20 kilometers (12 miles) or higher. These balloons are often used for scientific research, atmospheric measurements, weather observations, telecommunications, and even space tourism experiments.</p>

<h2>Toilets in space</h2>
<h3>A new milestone</h3>
<div>
<p>Credit to Dr Pamela Gay on Twitter for identifying a new metric of the progress of human presence in space – how many toilets are in space! In March we reached the milestone of eleven toilets in space at the same time:</p>
