<h1 >Private Spaceflight in 2022</h1>
<div>
<img class="left" src="./2022img2.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">
<p>2021 was an extraordinary year for private spaceflight with over 20 private individuals flying to space on four different spacecraft. In this blog, I will take a look back at the achievements of 2021, as well a look forward to what we can expect from 2022.</p>
<p>Private space flight in 2022 reached new heights as companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic continued to push the boundaries of space exploration. These companies focused on various aspects of space travel, from satellite launches to crewed missions and even space tourism.</p>

<h2 >Virgin Galactic</h2>
<img class="right" src="./2022img3.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">
<p>Virgin Galactic started things off, becoming the first private company to fly passengers to suborbital space when they launched on July 11, 2021. Richard Branson was accompanied by three Virgin Galactic staff members on the flight that reached 86kms above Earth, allowing them to float in weightlessness for a few minutes.</p>
<p>In 2022, Virgin Galactic made significant progress in its mission to provide commercial space flights. The company successfully completed a series of test flights of its VSS Unity spacecraft, refining its technology and ensuring its safety. These test flights played a crucial role in gathering data and verifying the spacecraft's performance, bringing Virgin Galactic closer to its goal of offering regular space tourism experiences.</p>

<h2>Blue Origin</h2>
<img class="left" src="./2022img4.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">
<p>Virgin upstaged Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin by flying first, but Blue Origin certainly came out the better by the end of the year, completing a total of three flights, with 14 passengers.</p>
<p>One of the notable achievements by Blue Origin in 2022 was the successful launch and landing of its New Shepard rocket. This suborbital vehicle underwent several test flights to demonstrate its reusability and reliability. These launches not only validated the technology but also paved the way for future crewed missions and space tourism endeavors.</p>

<h2>SpaceX</h2>
<img class="right" src="./2022img5.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">
<p>September saw the first private orbital launch of the year with the Inspiration4 Mission. Conducted on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft the crew of four spent three days orbiting the Earth enjoying a spectacular views through the added dome window. The mission was paid for by Jared Isaacman, the billionaire founder of Shift4 payments and raised over $200m for St. Judes' Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>One of the major highlights for SpaceX in 2022 was the continued development and testing of its Starship spacecraft. This fully reusable vehicle, designed for interplanetary travel, underwent several successful test flights. These flights included high-altitude tests, demonstrating the capabilities of Starship's propulsion system, aerodynamics, and landing procedures.</p>
